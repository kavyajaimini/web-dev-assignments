# Employee Onboarding App

This is a friendly web app that helps new employees get started and lets HR manage the onboarding process—all in your browser.

## What can you do here?

- Pick your role: Are you HR or an Employee?
- If you’re an Employee, you’ll fill out a simple step-by-step form, upload your documents, and save your progress as you go.
- If you’re HR, you can see everyone who’s onboarded, check their details, and approve or reject them.
- Don’t worry about losing your work—everything is saved in your browser until you’re done.
